# OpenFMSL
The Open Flowsheet Modeling Library is a collection of C# libraries that can be used to simulate stationary chemical processes using mass- and energy balances. The library includes a basic implementation of the IKCAPE Thermodynamics and a handful of simple unit operations. The resulting equation system is solved simulatenously using a Newton-type solver using the L/U decomposition provided in CSPARSE.net.
